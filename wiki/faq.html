          <h2>General questions</h2>

          <h3>What is ValueApp in one sentence?</h3>
          <p>
            ValueApp is a digital implementation of the ETH Value Method that supports transparent,
            data-informed estimation of planning effort and fees across building projects.
          </p>

          <h3>Who develops and maintains ValueApp?</h3>
          <p>
            The method originates from research at ETH Zürich and is applied and further developed in
            practice by a r c experts together with national and international partners such as OAI and SIA.
          </p>

          <h3>Is ValueApp a replacement for national fee regulations?</h3>
          <p>
            No. ValueApp does not replace legal or contractual frameworks. It complements them by offering
            a structured way to discuss planning effort, scope and project complexity using a transparent
            set of assumptions.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Method &amp; interpretation</h2>

          <h3>Does ValueApp deliver a “correct” fee?</h3>
          <p>
            ValueApp does not claim to produce a single “correct” number. Instead, it provides a
            consistent, reproducible basis for discussion that can be compared across projects and scenarios.
          </p>

          <h3>How should I read the planning effort results?</h3>
          <p>
            The calculated effort is best understood as an indicative volume that reflects the declared
            scope and project characteristics. It is particularly useful for:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Comparing project variants or scopes</li>
            <li>Structuring internal resource planning</li>
            <li>Providing a transparent basis in fee discussions</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Can I adjust assumptions to local practice?</h3>
          <p>
            National adaptations and partner configurations may include parameters calibrated to local
            practice. For specific calibration questions, please refer to the contact channels listed on
            the main website.

          <h2>Usage &amp; collaboration</h2>

          <h3>Who typically uses ValueApp inside an office?</h3>
          <p>
            Typical users include partners and project leaders responsible for fee proposals, resource
            planning and contract discussions. In larger organisations, specialised calculation or
            controlling roles might also work with ValueApp.
          </p>

          <h3>Can clients see or use ValueApp directly?</h3>
          <p>
            In many constellations, results are shared with clients as part of a discussion, while direct
            access depends on contractual and organisational decisions. The transparency of assumptions is
            intentionally designed to support such shared discussions.
          </p>

          <h3>How does ValueApp handle different disciplines?</h3>
          <p>
            The method and software are designed to represent architectural, civil and building services
            contributions. Depending on the configuration, discipline-specific views and distributions can
            be explored in more detail.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>Technical &amp; integration questions</h2>

          <h3>Can ValueApp integrate with other digital tools?</h3>
          <p>
            Integration options depend on the technical setup and national configuration. The main
            website’s integration section provides an entry point for technical documentation and example
            integrations.
          </p>

          <p>
            For technical collaboration, please refer to the
            <a href="../index.html#integration">integration section</a> on the main site.
          </p>

          <h3>Who do I contact for pilot projects or research collaborations?</h3>
          <p>
            Pilot projects and research collaborations are typically coordinated between ETH Zürich,
            a r c experts and relevant professional partners. Use the contact address listed on the main
            website to describe your context and interests.
          </p>

          <h3>When in doubt</h3>
          <p>
            Treat ValueApp as a structured conversation tool rather than a black box. If a result looks
            surprising, review the assumptions first before the number.

    "valueDelivery.p1":
      "As transparency and fairness become central to public procurement, the Value Method provides a clear and verifiable approach to calculating planning effort and professional fees.",
    "valueDelivery.p2":
      "Instead of relying on construction costs, the method works with measurable and documented values – transparent determinants such as square metres, cubic metres or unit counts. These are linked to a labour input based on standardised base models.",
    "valueDelivery.p3":
      "Project-specific complexity and context are incorporated through an adjustment factor, derived using the Leadership Framework for Decision Making. This keeps the method both data-informed and context-sensitive.",

    "method.title": "Introducing the Value Method",
    "method.p1":
      "The Value Method is built on two core principles: legal transparency (equal treatment and non-discrimination) and methodological traceability (transparency in information and calculation).",
    "method.p2":
      "By separating objective determinants from qualitative assessment, the method makes fee modelling understandable for all parties involved – clients, planners and authorities.",
    "method.p3":
      "The approach has been developed at ETH Zurich and validated using real project data. It is continuously refined with partners from practice and professional associations.",

    "timeEffort.title": "Time-Effort and Adjustments",
    "timeEffort.p1":
      "The Value Method uses base models with prediction intervals that cover around 80% of comparable cases. These intervals are structured in deciles, reflecting typical variation across projects.",
    "timeEffort.p2":
      "The goal is not numerical pseudo-precision but a plausible, transparent range for planning effort. Cases in the outer deciles – especially the 1st and 10th – indicate special requirements and call for qualitative reflection.",

    "baseModels.title": "Base Models in the Value Method",

    "leadership.p2":
      "In the Value Method, the framework is used to position project-specific challenges – technical, organisational, spatial or design-related – and to derive a consistent adjustment factor.",
    "leadership.application":
      "By mapping challenges onto this framework, the method derives an adjustment factor that reflects complexity and coordination effort. Typical reference projects in the complicated domain use a factor around 1; more complex or chaotic contexts may justifiably require higher effort.",

    "wiki.faq.q1.question":
      "Does the ValueApp replace fee regulations such as SIA LHO?",
    "wiki.faq.q1.answer":
      "No. The ValueApp implements the ETH Value Method and provides transparent, traceable effort ranges based on determinants and complexity. It can be used together with fee regulations such as SIA LHO to derive honourable, non-discriminatory fee offers.",

    "wiki.faq.q2.question":
      "Why does the app not use construction costs as input?",
    "wiki.faq.q2.answer":
      "Construction costs depend on market conditions, timing and procurement strategies and can introduce distortions. The Value Method uses determinants such as gross floor area that are easier to document and compare across projects.",

    "wiki.faq.q3.question":
      "Is the output a fixed number of hours or a range?",
    "wiki.faq.q3.answer":
      "The base models provide prediction intervals, not a single pseudo-precise value. The adjustment factors and your inputs lead to a plausible range which can then be translated into planning assumptions and fee models.",

    "wiki.faq.section.usage.title": "Using the app",
    "wiki.faq.q4.question":
      "How detailed should the project description be?",
    "wiki.faq.q4.answer":
      "Aim for one short paragraph covering starting situation, task and key constraints. The description should be detailed enough that someone else can understand the project and interpret the hours a year later.",

    "wiki.faq.q5.question":
      "How do I deal with mixed uses (e.g. housing and retail)?",
    "wiki.faq.q5.answer":
      "Enter the total gross floor area and assign percentages to the relevant uses. The app combines the corresponding base models according to the mix. If one use is very minor, you can decide whether it is worth modelling separately.",

    "wiki.faq.q6.question":
      "What if I am unsure about the complexity assessment?",
    "wiki.faq.q6.answer":
      "Start with your best estimate and document the reasoning briefly in the challenges. If you discuss the project internally, you can adjust the position in the leadership framework and see how it affects the effort. The transparency is more important than hitting a “perfect” value.",

    "wiki.faq.q7.question":
      "Can I override the hours per phase?",
    "wiki.faq.q7.answer":
      "Yes. The suggested distribution is based on typical patterns. If your project has an unusually heavy execution phase or a reduced design phase, you can adjust the percentages. It is good practice to document why.",

    "wiki.faq.section.technical.title": "Technical and data",
    "wiki.faq.q8.question":
      "How often are the base models updated?",
    "wiki.faq.q8.answer":
      "Base models are updated periodically with new realised projects and refined as more data become available. This ensures that effort ranges remain aligned with contemporary practice.",

    "wiki.faq.q9.question":
      "Can the ValueApp be integrated into our own IT systems?",
    "wiki.faq.q9.answer":
      "Yes. The core logic can be embedded as a widget into external platforms and client portals. Technical documentation and examples are available in the separate integration repository.",

      "Nein. Die ValueApp setzt die ETH Value Method um und liefert transparente, nachvollziehbare Aufwandskorridore auf Basis von Determinanten und Komplexität. Sie kann zusammen mit Honorarordnungen wie der SIA LHO genutzt werden, um faire, nichtdiskriminierende Honorarangebote abzuleiten.",

    "wiki.faq.q2.question":
      "Warum verwendet die Anwendung keine Baukosten als Eingabe?",
    "wiki.faq.q2.answer":
      "Baukosten hängen von Markt, Zeitpunkt und Beschaffungsstrategie ab und können Verzerrungen verursachen. Die Value Method verwendet Determinanten wie Bruttogeschossfläche, die einfacher zu dokumentieren und projektübergreifend vergleichbar sind.",

    "wiki.faq.q5.question":
      "Wie gehe ich mit Mischnutzungen (z. B. Wohnen und Retail) um?",
    "wiki.faq.q5.answer":
      "Erfassen Sie die gesamte Bruttogeschossfläche und verteilen Sie sie prozentual auf die relevanten Nutzungen. Die Anwendung kombiniert die entsprechenden Basismodelle gemäss Nutzungsmix. Ist eine Nutzung sehr klein, können Sie entscheiden, ob sich eine separate Modellierung lohnt.",

    "wiki.faq.q6.question":
      "Was, wenn ich bei der Komplexitätsbeurteilung unsicher bin?",
    "wiki.faq.q6.answer":
      "Beginnen Sie mit einer plausiblen Einschätzung und dokumentieren Sie die Überlegungen kurz in den Herausforderungen.

      "Kann ich die Stunden pro Phase überschreiben?",
    "wiki.faq.q7.answer":
      "Ja. Die vorgeschlagene Verteilung basiert auf typischen Mustern. Wenn Ihr Projekt eine besonders aufwändige Ausführung oder eine reduzierte Entwurfsphase hat, können Sie die Anteile anpassen. Es ist gute Praxis, den Grund kurz zu dokumentieren.",

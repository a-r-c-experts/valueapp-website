      "As transparency and fairness become central to public procurement, the Value Method provides a clear and verifiable approach to calculating planning effort and professional fees.",
    "valueDelivery.p2":
      "Instead of relying on construction costs, the method works with measurable and documented values – transparent determinants such as square metres, cubic metres or unit counts. These are linked to a labour input based on standardised base models.",

    "method.p1":
      "The Value Method is built on two core principles: legal transparency (equal treatment and non-discrimination) and methodological traceability (transparency in information and calculation).",
    "method.p2":
      "By separating objective determinants from qualitative assessment, the method makes fee modelling understandable for all parties involved – clients, planners and authorities.",

    "timeEffort.title": "Time-Effort and Adjustments",

    "timeEffort.p2":
      "The goal is not numerical pseudo-precision but a plausible, transparent range for planning effort. Cases in the outer deciles – especially the 1st and 10th – indicate special requirements and call for qualitative reflection.",

    "leadership.application":

    "wiki.faq.section.general.title": "General",
    "wiki.faq.q1.question":
      "Does the ValueApp replace fee regulations such as SIA LHO?",
    "wiki.faq.q1.answer":
      "No. The ValueApp implements the ETH Value Method and provides transparent, traceable effort ranges based on determinants and complexity. It can be used together with fee regulations such as SIA LHO to derive honourable, non-discriminatory fee offers.",

    "wiki.faq.q2.question":
      "Why does the app not use construction costs as input?",
    "wiki.faq.q2.answer":
      "Construction costs depend on market conditions, timing and procurement strategies and can introduce distortions. The Value Method uses determinants such as gross floor area that are easier to document and compare across projects.",

    "wiki.faq.q3.question":
      "Is the output a fixed number of hours or a range?",
    "wiki.faq.q3.answer":
      "The base models provide prediction intervals, not a single pseudo-precise value. The adjustment factors and your inputs lead to a plausible range which can then be translated into planning assumptions and fee models.",

    "wiki.faq.section.usage.title": "Using the app",
    "wiki.faq.q4.question":
      "How detailed should the project description be?",
    "wiki.faq.q4.answer":
      "Aim for one short paragraph covering starting situation, task and key constraints. The description should be detailed enough that someone else can understand the project and interpret the hours a year later.",

    "wiki.faq.q5.question":
      "How do I deal with mixed uses (e.g. housing and retail)?",
    "wiki.faq.q5.answer":
      "Enter the total gross floor area and assign percentages to the relevant uses. The app combines the corresponding base models according to the mix. If one use is very minor, you can decide whether it is worth modelling separately.",

    "wiki.faq.q6.question":
      "What if I am unsure about the complexity assessment?",
    "wiki.faq.q6.answer":
      "Start with your best estimate and document the reasoning briefly in the challenges. If you discuss the project internally, you can adjust the position in the leadership framework and see how it affects the effort. The transparency is more important than hitting a “perfect” value.",

    "wiki.faq.q7.question":
      "Can I override the hours per phase?",
    "wiki.faq.q7.answer":
      "Yes. The suggested distribution is based on typical patterns. If your project has an unusually heavy execution phase or a reduced design phase, you can adjust the percentages. It is good practice to document why.",

    "wiki.faq.section.technical.title": "Technical and data",
    "wiki.faq.q8.question":
      "How often are the base models updated?",
    "wiki.faq.q8.answer":
      "Base models are updated periodically with new realised projects and refined as more data become available. This ensures that effort ranges remain aligned with contemporary practice.",

    "wiki.faq.q9.question":
      "Can the ValueApp be integrated into our own IT systems?",
    "wiki.faq.q9.answer":
      "Yes. The core logic can be embedded as a widget into external platforms and client portals. Technical documentation and examples are available in the separate integration repository.",

      "Where can I report bugs or suggest improvements?",

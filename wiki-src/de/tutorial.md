# Tutorial – step-by-step through the ValueApp
## This tutorial walks you through the ValueApp using an example project. The focus is on what to enter in each tab and how to read the results.

---

## Overview — Four tabs, one method

The ValueApp is structured into four tabs: **Beschrieb**, **Projekt**, **Leistung** and **Zusammenfassung**.  
They follow the logic of the ETH Value Method from project context to effort and service distribution.

*The app connects project description, determinants, adjustment factors and services into one coherent flow.*

## Step 1 — Beschrieb (describe the project)

Start with a clear project description. This information appears in reports and provides context when you compare projects later.

- Enter the project title and address.  
- Set the status (e.g. “In Planung” or “Ausführung”).  
- Describe the starting situation, task and key constraints in 5–10 lines.  
- Define the organisational setup on the planning and contractor side.

    Use the “Speichern” button in the app to store your progress.
    The “Feedback” button opens a short form where you can report issues or suggest improvements.

## Step 2 — Projekt (quantity, uses and complexity)

In the **Projekt** tab you translate the brief into numbers and a complexity assessment.

### 2.1 Determinant and use mix

Enter the determinating quantity, usually the gross floor area (GF).  
Then assign percentages of this area to the relevant uses.

*All GF assigned to “Ausbilden und forschen”.*

### 2.2 Complexity and challenges

Describe project challenges in four dimensions (design, technical, spatial, organisational)  
and position them in the leadership framework.

*Description of project-specific challenges and their position in the framework.*

The app calculates an adjustment factor based on the centre of gravity of your entries.
This factor shifts the expected effort within the prediction interval of the base model.

### 2.3 Risk level

Set the risk level: **none**, **increased**, or **high** requirements.  
This reflects uncertainty and can influence the upper part of the effort range.

## Step 3 — Leistung (role and hours by phase)

In the **Leistung** tab you define your responsibility and see how the calculated hours distribute across phases.

- Choose your role (Architect / Architect & General planner / General planner)  
- Highlight focus topics (design, construction management, cost planning)  
- Review the total hours for 100% basic services  
- Adjust SIA phase distribution where justified

### Multiple disciplines

For multi-discipline projects (architecture, structural, electrical, HVAC, sanitary):  
repeat the steps in **Projekt** & **Leistung** for each discipline.  
The summary will show them side-by-side.

## Step 4 — Zusammenfassung (reading the one-pager)

The **Zusammenfassung** tab compiles all relevant information into a structured overview:

- project description  
- organisational setup  
- use mix  
- effort per m²  
- risk level  
- hours by SIA phase  
- additional services when relevant  

You can export or print this page and attach it to fee offers or internal planning documents.
It documents why a certain effort level is plausible given the project’s determinants and complexity.

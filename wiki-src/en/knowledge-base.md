# Knowledge base

This chapter explains **why the ValueApp behaves the way it does**.  
It focuses on concepts and logic, not on click-by-click instructions.

If you are looking for practical steps, go to the [Workflows](workflows.html).

## Core concepts

The following pages explain the key concepts that directly shape the results produced by the ValueApp.  
Each concept is documented in plain language and linked to where it appears in the app.

- **Quantity / project size**  
  What “size” means in the ValueApp, why it matters, and how it sets the baseline for effort estimation.  
  → [Open quantity](quantity.html)

- **Use categories (building programs)**  
  How the ValueApp selects reference models based on project use and why mixed-use projects are handled as weighted combinations.  
  → [Open use categories](use-categories.html)

- **Complexity dimensions**  
  How design, technical, spatial, and organisational complexity are assessed and why similar-sized projects can behave very differently.  
  → [Open complexity dimensions](complexity.html)

- **Roles and services**  
  How roles (e.g. architect, general planner) and service scope influence effort distribution and totals.  
  → [Open roles and services](roles-and-services.html)

- **Adjustment / leadership factor**  
  How organisational and process-related demands are reflected in the model and how they modify results.  
  → [Open adjustment factor](adjustment-factor.html)

- **Interpreting results**  
  How to read hours, ranges, and distributions correctly, and what the results are suitable (and not suitable) for.  
  → [Open result interpretation](output-interpretation.html)

- **What ValueApp is – and what it is not**  
  A clarification of the app’s purpose, limits, and common misunderstandings.  
  → [Open purpose and limits](why-valueapp.html)

## How to use this chapter

Use the Knowledge Base when you want to understand:

- why a change in input affects the result,
- why the app shows ranges instead of fixed values,
- how different project setups lead to different effort profiles,
- where professional judgement is still required.

For concrete workflows and examples, switch to:

- [Workflows](workflows.html)
- [Examples](examples.html)

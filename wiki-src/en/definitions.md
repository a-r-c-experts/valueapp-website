# Definitions and concepts
## This page explains the main concepts behind the ValueApp and the ETH Value Method: base models, determinants, the leadership framework and the structure of the app.

---

## What the ValueApp does

The ValueApp estimates planning effort (hours) for different disciplines based on transparent, documented determinants.  
Instead of construction costs, it uses measurable quantities such as gross floor area and links them to statistical base models.

Project-specific complexity and context are incorporated through adjustment factors derived from the Leadership Framework for Decision Making.  
The result is a plausible, transparent range for planning effort that can be documented and communicated.

---

## Core formula

In simplified form, the method can be written as:

**Aufwand (h) = LI (h) × Determinant × AF<sub>Qualität</sub> × AF<sub>Projekt/Prozess</sub>**

where:

- **LI** is the base workload per unit (e.g. minutes per m² gross floor area) from the statistical base model.  
- The **determinant** is a transparent, measurable quantity such as gross floor area GF.  
- **AF<sub>Qualität</sub>** is an adjustment factor derived from the leadership framework, based on design, technical, spatial and organisational challenges.  
- **AF<sub>Projekt/Prozess</sub>** covers further project- and process-specific adjustments where applicable.  

---

## Base models and determinants

The base models are built from realised projects. For each usage type, they link the determinating quantity (typically m² GF) to intervals of planning effort.  
These intervals cover around 80% of comparable cases and are structured in deciles.

*Example: multi-family house at a given gross floor area within the 80% prediction interval.*

The ValueApp currently uses usage-based models such as: **Housing**, **Working/Services**, **Industry**, **Storage**, **Learning/Research** and **Healing/Care**.  
Each model assumes 100% basic services for the corresponding discipline.

## Leadership framework and complexity

The Leadership Framework for Decision Making classifies situations based on the clarity of cause and effect.  
It distinguishes simple, complicated, complex and chaotic domains and suggests different approaches for each.

*Leadership framework: from simple via complicated and complex to chaotic decision contexts.*

In the ValueApp, you describe challenges in four dimensions: **design**, **technical**, **spatial** and **organisational**.  
These challenges are positioned within the framework, and their “centre of gravity” leads to an adjustment factor for quality and complexity.

*Project-specific challenges positioned in the framework; the centre of gravity gives the adjustment factor.*

## Structure of the ValueApp

The app is organised into four main tabs that mirror the logic of the method:

- **Beschrieb** – project context, address, organisational setup and status.  
- **Projekt** – determinating quantity, use mix, complexity and risk.  
- **Leistung** – your role, focus topics and hours per phase.  
- **Zusammenfassung** – consolidated one-pager for communication and documentation.

*The ValueApp connects project description, determinants, adjustment factors and services into one consistent model.*

## Fields in the app: recommended usage

### Beschrieb

Use the project title and address to identify the project clearly in reports and internal systems.  
The project description should briefly cover starting situation, task, key constraints and central themes that are likely to influence complexity.

### Projekt

Enter the determinating quantity (typically m² gross floor area) and assign percentages of the total to the relevant uses.  
Then assess complexity across the four dimensions and set the risk level (**no special**, **increased**, **high**).

### Leistung

Choose your contractual role and highlight focus topics.  
Review the calculated hours for 100% basic services and their distribution over phases.  
Adjust phase percentages in justified cases.

### Zusammenfassung

The summary compiles all inputs and calculated results into a traceable overview.  
It is designed to be attached to fee offers, internal controlling documents or procurement procedures.

## Glossary

**Determinant (determinierende Grösse).**  
Measurable quantity that drives the base model, usually the gross floor area GF relevant for the project scope.

**Base model (Grundmodell).**  
Statistical model for a usage type that links determinants to effort ranges for 100% basic services.

**Prediction interval (Prognoseintervall).**  
Range that covers most comparable projects (around 80%). It is structured in deciles and reflects typical variation.

**AF Qualität.**  
Adjustment factor derived from the leadership framework based on design, technical, spatial and organisational challenges.

**Basic services (Grundleistungen).**  
Scope of standard services defined in professional regulations (e.g. SIA), assumed at 100% in the base models.

**Additional services (Zusätzliche Leistungen).**  
Project-specific services beyond basic services that can be documented separately.

  <h3>Method sources</h3>
  <p>
    The Value Method and the ValueApp are based on research at ETH Zürich and developed
    together with practice partners and professional associations.
    Reference models are continuously updated with realised project data.

  <h3>Tip for users</h3>
  <p>
    In everyday work, you do not need to know every statistical detail.
    Focus on providing a clear project description, realistic quantities,
    an honest complexity assessment and a transparent distribution of services across phases.

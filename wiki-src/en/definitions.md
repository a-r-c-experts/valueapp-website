# Definitions and core concepts

This page explains the key ideas behind the ValueApp and the ETH Value Method: **base models**, **determinants**, **adjustment factors**, and how they combine into an effort range.

If you mainly want to learn by doing, go straight to the [Tutorial](tutorial.html) or the [Examples](examples.html).

## What the ValueApp estimates

The ValueApp estimates planning effort (hours) for different disciplines based on transparent determinants. Instead of construction cost, it uses measurable quantities such as **gross floor area** and links them to statistical **base models**.

Project‑specific context is added through **adjustment factors** derived from the Leadership Framework.

## Simplified core formula

**Effort (h) = LI × Determinant × AF_quality × AF_project/process**

Where:

- **LI**: base effort per unit from the base model (e.g. minutes per m²).
- **Determinant**: the measurable scaling quantity (typically m² gross floor area).
- **AF_quality**: adjustment factor based on complexity in design/technical/spatial/organisational dimensions.
- **AF_project/process**: additional project or process adjustments where relevant.

The practical place to enter most of this is the [Project section](project-section.html).

## Base models and determinants

Base models are built from realised reference projects. For each use type, they connect a determinant (typically m²) with effort intervals. These intervals are usually shown as an 80% prediction band structured into deciles.

## Adjustment factors

Adjustment factors are used to represent complexity and context that the determinant alone cannot capture.

### AF_quality

AF_quality is derived from the Leadership Framework by positioning challenges across four dimensions:

- design,
- technical,
- spatial,
- organisational.

It is meant to be explicit and discussable, not “hidden calibration”.

### AF_project/process

Where applicable, additional factors reflect process and project setup (for example procurement, collaboration model, constraints, etc.).

## Prediction intervals

A prediction interval is a range that covers the majority of comparable projects (often around 80%). It is not a guarantee. It is a structured way to express uncertainty and variability.

# Complexity dimensions

Complexity describes **how difficult the planning task itself is**, independent of size and organisation.

It captures **what must be designed, coordinated, and resolved within the object**, not how the project is managed.  
That distinction matters, because complexity and leadership effort are **separate drivers of workload** in ValueApp.

---

## What complexity means in ValueApp

In ValueApp, complexity reflects:
- the **nature of the design task**,
- the **technical and spatial interdependencies**,
- the **degree of uncertainty within the solution itself**.

It answers the question:

> *“How difficult is it to design and resolve this project?”*

Not:
- how many people are involved,
- how messy the client is,
- how political the process becomes.

Those belong to the **adjustment (leadership) factor**, not here.

## The four complexity dimensions

Complexity is assessed across **four independent dimensions**.  
Each dimension captures a different source of design and coordination effort.

![Overview of complexity dimensions](\/wiki-assets/knowledge/complexity-dimensions-overview.jpeg)

### 1. Design (Gestalterisch)

This dimension reflects:
- formal ambition,
- architectural articulation,
- design-driven iteration and refinement.

Low complexity:
- standardised layouts,
- repetitive structures,
- limited variation.

Higher complexity:
- strong formal intent,
- many design iterations,
- high demands on coherence and detail.

---

### 2. Technical (Technisch)

This dimension captures:
- technical systems,
- building services integration,
- engineering dependencies.

Low complexity:
- conventional systems,
- proven solutions,
- few interfaces.

Higher complexity:
- dense technical infrastructure,
- innovative or uncommon systems,
- tight tolerances and coordination loops.

---

### 3. Spatial (Räumlich)

Spatial complexity relates to:
- three-dimensional organisation,
- circulation and access,
- spatial interlocking and constraints.

Low complexity:
- simple volumes,
- clear zoning,
- minimal interdependencies.

Higher complexity:
- stacked or intertwined spaces,
- complex circulation,
- constrained sites or transformations.

---

### 4. Organisational (Organisatorisch)

This dimension reflects **object-related organisational difficulty**, not project management.

It includes:
- phasing within the building,
- interfaces between uses,
- operational coexistence (e.g. building while in use).

Low complexity:
- single use,
- clear operational logic.

Higher complexity:
- mixed-use environments,
- overlapping operational requirements,
- continuous operation during construction.

## How complexity is assessed

Each dimension is positioned along a spectrum from:
**simple → complicated → complex**

The assessment is **qualitative but structured**.  
It does not require exact measurement, but it does require honesty.

![Complexity assessment scale](\/wiki-assets/knowledge/complexity-assessment-scale.jpeg)

You are not rating “good” or “bad”.  
You are stating **how demanding the design task is likely to be**.

## How complexity affects results

Complexity:
- increases baseline effort,
- affects all planning phases,
- influences both mean effort and uncertainty range.

Higher complexity typically means:
- more coordination between disciplines,
- more iteration,
- more time spent resolving conflicts.

It does **not**:
- increase scope of services,
- replace contractual definitions,
- justify effort on its own without quantity.

Complexity always works **together with quantity**, not instead of it.

---

## Where complexity appears in the app

You encounter complexity in:

- **Project definition**  
  When assessing the four dimensions during setup.

- **Baseline calculation**  
  Where it modifies effort derived from quantity and use.

- **Result interpretation**  
  Where higher complexity explains increased hours even at similar size.

## Common mistakes to avoid

Do not:
- rate complexity based on personal pride,
- use complexity to compensate for unclear scope,
- assume “interesting project” means “complex project”.

If complexity feels hard to justify, that is often a signal that:
- the project definition is still vague, or
- organisational issues are being mixed into the wrong category.

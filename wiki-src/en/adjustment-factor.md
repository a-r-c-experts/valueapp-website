# Adjustment factor (Leadership factor)

The adjustment factor reflects **how demanding the project setup is beyond size and basic complexity**.  
It captures organisational, procedural, and coordination-related effort that cannot be derived from quantities alone.

It does **not** reward ambition, quality, or design excellence.  
It models **management and leadership load**.

---

## What it is

The adjustment factor is a **multiplicative modifier** applied to the baseline effort calculated from quantity, use, and complexity.

It represents the additional effort required to:
- coordinate multiple stakeholders,
- manage decision-making structures,
- handle process-related uncertainty,
- lead complex planning organisations.

In short: it answers *“How hard is this project to lead?”*, not *“How good is the project?”*.

## Why it exists in ValueApp

Projects with identical size and complexity can require very different effort because of:
- fragmented responsibilities,
- unclear decision authority,
- tight schedules with many interfaces,
- unstable client or user requirements.

Without an adjustment factor, these differences would be invisible in the model and systematically underestimated.

The adjustment factor exists to:
- make leadership effort explicit,
- prevent unrealistic baseline assumptions,
- allow transparent discussion of organisational risk.

---

## What influences the adjustment factor

The factor is derived from a structured assessment of **leadership and process conditions**, typically including:

- **Organisational setup**  
  Number of parties, hierarchy, contractual structure.

- **Decision-making clarity**  
  Clear authority vs. distributed or shifting responsibilities.

- **Process stability**  
  Fixed scope and timeline vs. iterative or evolving processes.

- **Coordination intensity**  
  Interfaces between disciplines, authorities, users, and external actors.

These inputs are assessed qualitatively and mapped to a calibrated adjustment range.

## How it affects results

The adjustment factor:
- scales the total calculated effort,
- affects **all phases**, not just early design,
- widens effort ranges when uncertainty is high.

A higher adjustment factor means:
- more coordination time,
- more meetings and alignment loops,
- higher management overhead.

It does **not**:
- change the underlying scope of services,
- guarantee higher fees,
- replace professional judgement.

## Where it appears in the app

You encounter the adjustment factor in:

- **Project setup**  
  As part of the organisational and process-related inputs.

- **Service overview**  
  Where total hours are adjusted accordingly.

- **Result summary**  
  Where its impact is visible in the effort range and total hours.

## How to use it responsibly

Use the adjustment factor to:
- discuss leadership effort early,
- explain differences between comparable projects,
- document assumptions transparently.

Do **not** use it to:
- artificially inflate results,
- compensate for missing scope definition,
- argue precision where uncertainty remains high.

If you feel tempted to “tune” the factor until the number looks right, that’s usually a sign that the project setup needs clarification instead.

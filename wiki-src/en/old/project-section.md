# General information – Project section
## How the ValueApp uses floor area, use mix and complexity to generate an initial effort forecast (min/m² FA).

---

## What happens in the Project section

In the **Project** section, the ValueApp generates an initial forecast of the expected time effort (**min/m² FA**) based on:

- six **time-effort models** (by use category)
- an **adjustment factor** (the so-called *degree of complexity*)

You can adjust the generated forecasts individually at any time.

The six time-effort models deliver the most reliable baseline forecast.  
The degree of complexity adjusts the result based on project-specific conditions and is always defined per project.

---

## Use

### Floor area (FA)

In the Project definition field, first enter the approximate **floor area (FA)** across all uses in **m²**.

If you already have a space allocation plan, you can also reference it in the description. It is recommended to document your FA calculation transparently for other project participants, especially the client.

Please note: the specified area directly affects the calculated effort.

### Expected costs (optional)

Expected costs are optional and do **not** influence the time-effort forecast.  
They are understood as the client’s budget.

During the test phase, the ValueApp serves as a plausibility check for decisions regarding:

- task and scope  
- determinants  
- use mix  
- complexity  

---

## Use mix

You must specify the use(s) of the project.

You can select several uses (including repeated uses) via drag-and-drop and assign their relative shares.

In the background, the ValueApp applies the corresponding effort model for the selected uses and generates an initial forecast (**min/m² FA**).  
You can adjust these forecasts individually at any time.

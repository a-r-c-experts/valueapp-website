# Why the ValueApp exists

## The problem in practice

In early project phases, planning effort is often discussed on an insufficiently robust basis:

- Construction costs are still uncertain, yet an effort estimate is expected “somehow”.
- Reference projects exist, but are rarely well documented or directly comparable.
- Complexity is described intuitively rather than in a structured way (and later the deviations come as a surprise).
- Communication between clients, planning teams, and internal stakeholders remains vague.

The typical consequences are flawed assumptions, friction, poor expectation management, and unnecessary iteration loops.

## What the ValueApp does differently

The ValueApp combines the ETH Value Method with a clear, guided user experience. It is based on:

1. **Measurable determinants**  
   Instead of “cost”, quantities such as gross floor area (m²) are the primary drivers.

2. **Reference-based base models**  
   Effort ranges are derived from realised projects, deliberately using ranges instead of false precision.

3. **Structured description of complexity**  
   Complexity is described across distinct dimensions (design, technical, spatial, organisational) and systematised through the Leadership Framework.

4. **Transparent documentation**  
   Inputs, assumptions, and results are presented in a way that makes them traceable, communicable, and reviewable.

## Typical use cases

- **Early project phases:** Effort ranges for decision-making and proposal processes
- **Plausibility checks:** Comparison between projects, variants, or use mixes
- **Communication:** A shared language for complexity and expectation management
- **Internal steering:** Rough capacity and phase planning (depending on the organisation)

## Delimitation from cost or fee tools

The ValueApp is neither a cost tool nor a fee calculator.

- **Cost/fee tools:** typically “cost → fee”, highly dependent on cost benchmarks and project definition  
- **ValueApp:** “determinant + reference data + complexity → effort (h)”, with a focus on transparency and plausibility

This means the ValueApp can support fee discussions, but it does not replace service definitions, contractual logic, or project-specific delineations.

## Why ranges matter

In early phases, “a single number” is almost always a trap.  
Ranges make uncertainty visible instead of hiding it.

The app therefore aims for:
- traceable intervals
- comparable reference values
- documented assumptions

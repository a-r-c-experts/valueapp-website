# Roles and services

Roles and services define **what part of the planning work is covered by the calculation**.

They do not describe:
- personal responsibility,
- contractual risk,
- or who is ultimately liable.

They describe **which services are included in the effort model**.

## What “role” means in ValueApp

In ValueApp, a role represents:
- the **planning position you are taking** in the project,
- relative to other planners and the client.

It answers the question:

> *“From which planning perspective is this effort being calculated?”*

Not:
- who signs the contract,
- who carries insurance,
- or how the team is staffed internally.

---

## Typical roles

Depending on the setup, common roles include:

- **Architect**  
  Planning services within the architectural discipline.

- **Architect as general planner**  
  Architectural services plus coordination of other planners.

- **Discipline planner**  
  Structural, building services, or specialist planning roles.

- **Supporting role**  
  Partial services within a larger planning organisation.

Each role implies:
- a different **service scope**,
- a different **coordination load**,
- a different distribution of effort across phases.

## What “services” mean

Services define:
- **which planning phases are included**,
- **which tasks are assumed**, at a high level.

They are based on:
- standard service models (e.g. SIA, HOAI, OAI),
- adapted to a **generic, comparable structure**.

ValueApp does not calculate:
- bespoke task lists,
- project-specific exclusions,
- contractual special clauses.

It calculates **100% of the selected basic services**.

## Why roles and services exist in the model

Two projects with identical quantity and complexity can differ drastically if:
- one planner coordinates all disciplines,
- another only delivers partial services.

Without roles and services:
- effort comparisons would be meaningless,
- leadership effort would be double-counted or missed,
- results would appear inconsistent.

Roles and services exist to:
- anchor responsibility assumptions,
- distribute effort correctly across phases,
- avoid implicit scope creep.

---

## How they affect results

Roles and services influence:

- **Total effort**  
  Through included service scope.

- **Phase distribution**  
  Early vs late planning effort.

- **Coordination load**  
  Especially for general planners.

They do **not**:
- change the baseline quantity,
- replace complexity assessment,
- account for exceptional services.

If your scope deviates significantly from standard services, document it externally.

## Where roles and services appear in the app

You define them in:

- **Service selection step**  
  Choosing role and service scope.

- **Phase overview**  
  Showing effort distribution per phase.

- **Result summary**  
  Clarifying what the calculated hours actually cover.

## Using roles responsibly

Good practice:
- choose the role that matches your **actual planning position**,
- use standard services as the baseline,
- explain deviations outside the app.

Avoid:
- selecting broader roles to “cover uncertainty”,
- narrowing services to force a target number,
- mixing internal staffing logic with service scope.

If the role choice feels uncomfortable, that usually signals an unclear project setup, not a calculation problem.

# Best Practices and Recommendations

This page summarizes proven practices for working with the ValueApp. Its purpose is to support **correct interpretation**, **consistent application**, and **transparent communication** of results.

## General Principles

- The ValueApp provides **reference values**, not binding fees.
- Results must always be interpreted in their **project context**.
- Comparisons are meaningful only under **comparable conditions**.

## Project Setup

- Select the **appropriate base model** (e.g. housing, working, learning).
- Enter areas and parameters **consistently and transparently**.
- Avoid forcing special cases into unsuitable standard parameters.

## Interpreting Results

- Time values represent **ranges**, not exact figures.
- Small parameter changes may have **systematic effects**.
- Use scenario-based comparisons rather than isolated numbers.

## Data Quality and Reliability

- Result quality depends on **input quality**.
- Early-phase results are inherently **less precise**.
- Document assumptions and deviations clearly.

## Common Pitfalls

- Do not transfer results directly into contracts.
- Avoid comparisons across **different building typologies**.
- Do not back-calculate individual hourly rates.

## Collaboration and Communication

- Use the ValueApp as a **discussion tool**, not a final authority.
- Explain the **method and its limits** to clients.
- Align assumptions within the project team.

# Getting started with the ValueApp

The ValueApp guides you through four steps: project description, project definition, services, and summary.  
This page gives you a quick overview before you dive into the full tutorial.

## The four main steps

1. **Describe the project (Description)**  
   Enter name, address, status, and a short project description.  
   Define the organisational setup on the planning and contractor side (e.g. individual planners, general planner, general contractor).

2. **Define quantity, uses, and complexity (Project)**  
   Enter the determining quantity (usually gross floor area in m²), define the mix of uses, and assess complexity in four dimensions: design, technical, spatial, and organisational.  
   The app maps this assessment to the Leadership Framework to derive an adjustment factor.

3. **Define your role and services (Services)**  
   Select your role (e.g. architect, architect & general planner), highlight focus topics, and review the calculated hours for 100 % basic services, including their distribution across SIA phases 1–6.

4. **Review and export the summary (Summary)**  
   Check the generated one-pager with key project data, organisational setup, use mix, effort per m², and hours by phase.  
   You can export or print this as documentation for fee offers or procurement.

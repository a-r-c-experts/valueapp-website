## General

### Does the ValueApp replace fee regulations such as SIA LHO?

No. The ValueApp implements the **ETH Value Method** and provides transparent, traceable effort ranges based on determinants and complexity.  
It can be used together with fee regulations such as SIA LHO to derive fair and non-discriminatory fee offers.

### Why does the app not use construction costs as an input?

Construction costs depend heavily on market conditions, timing, and procurement strategy and can introduce distortions.  
The Value Method instead uses determinants such as **gross floor area**, which are easier to document and compare across projects.

### Is the output a fixed number of hours or a range?

The base models provide **prediction intervals**, not a pseudo-precise single value.  
Adjustment factors and inputs lead to a **plausible range**, which can then be translated into planning assumptions and fee models.

## Using the app

### How detailed should the project description be?

A short paragraph covering the initial situation, task, and key constraints is sufficient.  
The description should be clear enough that someone else can still understand the project and interpret the hours a year later.

### How do I deal with mixed uses (e.g. housing and retail)?

Enter the total gross floor area and assign percentage shares to the uses.  
The app combines the corresponding base models. Very small shares can optionally be ignored.

### What if I am unsure about the complexity assessment?

Start with your best estimate and briefly document the reasoning.  
Changes in the Leadership Framework immediately show how the effort changes.  
**Transparency is more important than a “perfect” value.**

### Can I override the hours per phase?

Yes. The suggested distribution is based on typical projects.  
If your project deviates, you can adjust the percentages.  
A short justification improves traceability.

## Technology and data

### How often are the base models updated?

Base models are periodically updated with newly realised projects and refined to keep results aligned with current practice.

### Can the ValueApp be integrated into our own IT systems?

Yes. The core logic can be embedded as a widget into external platforms and portals.  
Technical documentation and examples are available in the separate  
→ [Integration repository](https://github.com/a-r-c-experts/core-value-integration).

### Where can I report bugs or suggest improvements?

Use the **Feedback** button in the app.  
You can describe issues and, if helpful, reference a specific project or screenshot.

# Help and contact

This page explains **where to get help** if something is unclear or does not work as expected.

## Help with using the app

If you are unsure while using the ValueApp:

- First check the **FAQ** for common questions.  
  → [Open FAQ](faq.html)

- Use the **Workflows** for step-by-step instructions.  
  → [Workflows](workflows.html)

- For conceptual questions, consult the **Knowledge base**.  
  → [Knowledge base](knowledge-base.html)

## Feedback and requests

Within the ValueApp, a **Feedback button** is available. You can use it to:

- Report errors or inconsistencies  
- Submit improvement suggestions  
- Ask questions about specific projects  

It is helpful if you briefly describe:

- the context (project type, role)
- what you expected
- what actually happened

## Contact by email

If your request cannot be resolved directly via the app, you can also contact the ValueApp team by email:

- **info@core-value.ch**

Please indicate, if possible, which page or project your question refers to.

## Technical questions

For technical integrations or embedding the ValueApp:

- Technical documentation and examples are available in the separate integration repository.  
  → [Integration Repository](https://github.com/a-r-c-experts/core-value-integration)

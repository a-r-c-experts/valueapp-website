# Project section

The **Project (Projekt)** tab is where the ValueApp turns “what is it?” into “how complex is it?” and maps that to effort. This page explains the fields conceptually. For step‑by‑step clicks, use the [Tutorial](tutorial.html).

## What you define here

1. **Determinant / quantity** (typically m² gross floor area)
2. **Use mix** (housing, work, learning, etc.)
3. **Complexity** across four dimensions (design, technical, spatial, organisational)
4. **Risk / requirements** (if your version includes this concept)

These inputs drive the selection of base models and the adjustment factor(s).

## Determinant and use mix

The determinant is the measurable scale of the project. In most cases this is **gross floor area**. The use mix allocates that quantity across use categories so the app can combine the relevant base models.

## Complexity assessment

Complexity is not “big vs small”. It describes how clear cause and effect are, and how predictable the work is. The ValueApp uses the Leadership Framework to translate your assessment into an **AF_quality**.

If you want a deeper explanation of what AF_quality means, start with [Definitions](definitions.html) and [How the app works](how-it-works.html).

## Practical tips

- Be explicit: write down the key drivers in the project description.
- Calibrate with references: compare your project to [Examples](examples.html).
- Use the tool to structure discussion, not to avoid it.

# Project section

The **Project (Projekt)** tab is where the ValueApp turns “what is it?” into “what effort range is plausible?”  
It does this by combining:

- a measurable **determinant / quantity** (typically m² gross floor area),
- a **use mix** (so the right base models can be combined),
- a structured **complexity assessment** (mapped to the Leadership Framework),
- and, depending on your configuration, **risk / requirements** inputs.

This page explains the fields conceptually. If you want step-by-step clicks, use the [Tutorial](tutorial.html).

---

## What happens in the Project section

In the **Project** section, the ValueApp generates an initial forecast of expected time effort (often shown as **min/m²** based on the selected quantity) based on:

- **base models** (use-type models built from reference projects),
- and an **adjustment factor** derived from your complexity assessment (often referred to as *degree of complexity* or **AF_quality**).

You can adjust generated forecasts individually at any time, but the best results come from making your assumptions explicit and consistent.

If you want the “under the hood” story, see [How the app works](how-it-works.html).  
If terms like determinant, base model, or AF_quality feel vague, start with [Definitions](definitions.html).

---

## What you define here

1. **Determinant / quantity** (typically m² gross floor area)
2. **Use mix** (housing, work, learning, etc.)
3. **Complexity** across four dimensions (design, technical, spatial, organisational)
4. **Risk / requirements** (if your version includes this concept)
5. Optional contextual fields like **expected costs** (if present in your setup)

These inputs drive the selection of base models and the adjustment factor(s) that shift results within the prediction range.

## Determinant and quantity

### Floor area (FA / gross floor area)

In the Project definition field, enter the approximate **floor area** across all uses in **m²**.

If you already have a space allocation plan, reference it in the description. It is recommended to document your area calculation transparently for other project participants, especially the client.

**Important:** the specified area directly affects the calculated effort.  
Small changes in area can meaningfully shift the output.

---

## Expected costs (optional)

Expected costs are optional and typically do **not** influence the time-effort forecast.  
They are usually understood as the client’s budget.

In many setups, the ValueApp is used as a plausibility check for decisions regarding:

- task and scope,
- determinants,
- use mix,
- complexity.

---

## Use mix

You must specify the **use(s)** of the project.

You can select several uses (including repeated uses) and assign relative shares.  
In the background, the ValueApp combines the corresponding base models for those uses and generates an initial forecast.

**Key idea:** the use mix tells the app which reference world your project belongs to.  
A mixed-use project is not “one model with a weird label”, it is a **weighted combination** of models.

For calibration, compare your case to [Examples](examples.html).

---

## Complexity assessment

Complexity is not “big vs small”. It describes how predictable the work is and how clear cause-and-effect relationships are.

The ValueApp uses the **Leadership Framework** to translate your assessment into an **AF_quality** (or similar adjustment factor). You describe challenges across four dimensions:

- **design**
- **technical**
- **spatial**
- **organisational**

The point is not to find the one “correct” label. The point is to make assumptions **explicit and discussable**.

If you want a deeper explanation of what AF_quality means, start with [Definitions](definitions.html) and [How the app works](how-it-works.html).

---

## Practical tips

- **Be explicit:** write down key drivers in the project description (constraints, stakeholders, special requirements).
- **Calibrate with references:** compare your project to [Examples](examples.html).
- **Use the tool to structure discussion, not to avoid it:** the value is transparency, not pretending uncertainty doesn’t exist.

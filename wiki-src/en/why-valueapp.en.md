# Why ValueApp exists

Because “we feel it will take about X hours” is not documentation. This page explains what problem the ValueApp is trying to solve and where it fits (and does not fit) in everyday planning practice.

## The problem it addresses

Planning effort is real, but it is often communicated through:

- inconsistent assumptions,
- fuzzy benchmarks,
- and post‑hoc justifications that nobody trusts.

The ValueApp provides a **shared, transparent starting point**: a structured estimate based on reference projects plus explicit adjustments for complexity and context.

## Typical use cases

### Early phase orientation

When you have only rough quantities and a first understanding of the project, the app helps establish an effort range and makes assumptions explicit.

### Communication with clients and teams

Because the logic is documented (base model, determinant, adjustment factors), you can discuss the drivers of effort instead of arguing about vibes.

### Internal controlling and plausibility checks

Teams can compare projects across time, detect outliers and improve consistency.

## What it is not

- **Not a cost tool**: it does not estimate construction cost.
- **Not a fee calculator**: it does not output a contractual fee.
- **Not an automatic truth machine**: the output is a structured estimate that still needs professional judgement.

## How this relates to the method

The ValueApp operationalises the ETH Value Method by connecting:

- **base models** (reference projects),
- **determinants** (measurable quantities),
- and **adjustment factors** (complexity and context).

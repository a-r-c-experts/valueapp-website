# Examples

Examples help calibrate expectations and show how inputs influence results. If you are new, begin with [Getting started](getting-started.html) and then come back here.

## What these examples are for

- show how to translate a real project into determinants, use mix and complexity,
- demonstrate how adjustment factors move results,
- provide reference points for discussion.

## Suggested reading order

1. Start with [Definitions](definitions.html) if terms like LI, determinant or AF_quality are new.
2. Read [How the app works](how-it-works.html) for the conceptual pipeline.
3. Compare your case to these examples.
4. Use the [Tutorial](tutorial.html) to implement the steps in the app.

## Example types you should cover

- A simple, single‑use project (baseline)
- A complex, multi‑use project (mixed models, higher AF_quality)
- A “weird but real” edge case (odd inputs, special process constraints)

# What ValueApp is – and what it is not

ValueApp is often misunderstood because it produces numbers that *look* precise.  
This page clarifies **what ValueApp is designed to do** and, just as importantly, **what it is not meant for**.

Understanding these limits is essential for using the app responsibly.

---

## What ValueApp is

ValueApp is a **decision-support tool** for early and mid-stage planning.

It helps to:
- estimate planning effort ranges,
- make assumptions explicit,
- compare scenarios transparently,
- support informed discussions between planners and clients.

It is based on:
- empirical reference data,
- structured assessment of quantity, complexity, roles, and leadership effort,
- calibrated uncertainty ranges.

ValueApp supports judgement.  
It does not replace it.

## What ValueApp is not

### Not a fee calculator

ValueApp does **not** calculate fees.

It produces:
- effort ranges (hours),
- not contractual prices,
- not binding offers.

Fees depend on:
- market conditions,
- contractual arrangements,
- risk allocation,
- negotiation.

Using ValueApp outputs as “the fee” is a category error.

---

### Not a proposal generator

ValueApp does **not**:
- generate offers,
- define scope wording,
- replace service descriptions.

It cannot know:
- project-specific exclusions,
- contractual constraints,
- political or strategic considerations.

Proposals still require professional formulation.

---

### Not a controlling or monitoring tool

ValueApp is **not designed for**:
- time tracking,
- performance monitoring,
- benchmarking individual teams or people.

Using it for control:
- undermines trust,
- misreads uncertainty as deviation,
- contradicts the model’s intent.

ValueApp describes *expected effort*, not compliance.

---

### Not a quality or ambition rating

Higher results do **not** mean:
- better architecture,
- higher design quality,
- more ambitious projects.

The model does not reward:
- design excellence,
- innovation,
- aesthetic value.

It models **effort**, not merit.

---

### Not a risk transfer mechanism

ValueApp does **not**:
- remove project risk,
- justify underfunded scopes,
- turn uncertainty into certainty.

If uncertainty is high, the output will show it.
Suppressing that signal defeats the purpose.

---

## Why misunderstandings happen

Misuse often happens when:
- results are treated as exact numbers,
- ranges are collapsed into a single value,
- assumptions are ignored or hidden,
- outputs are detached from their context.

In most cases, the issue is not the model, but how it is presented.

---

## How to use ValueApp correctly

Use ValueApp to:
- discuss effort early and openly,
- compare alternatives,
- explain why projects differ,
- document assumptions transparently.

Do not use it to:
- force numbers to fit expectations,
- replace professional judgement,
- justify decisions after the fact.

If the output feels uncomfortable, that discomfort is usually informative.

## A final note

ValueApp does not make planning easy.  
It makes **assumptions visible**.

That visibility is the point.

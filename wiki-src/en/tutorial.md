# Tutorial

This tutorial walks through the ValueApp workflow from project description to summary. For background and terminology, keep [Definitions](definitions.html) open in another tab, like a normal person reading documentation.

## Step 1: Description (Beschrieb)

Capture:

- project title and address,
- status,
- organisational setup (planning side and contractor side),
- short text on scope and constraints.

Good descriptions make later complexity ratings defensible.

## Step 2: Project (Projekt)

Enter:

- the determinant (typically m² gross floor area),
- the use mix,
- complexity across design / technical / spatial / organisational.

This produces the adjustment factor used by the method. See [Project section](project-section.html) for field explanations.

## Step 3: Services (Leistung)

Select your role, mark focus topics and review:

- hours for 100% basic services,
- distribution across phases,
- any role‑dependent assumptions.

## Step 4: Summary (Zusammenfassung)

Validate plausibility and export the one‑pager for communication and documentation.

For the conceptual “why does this number change when I change that field” view, read [How the app works](how-it-works.html) and [Why ValueApp exists](why-valueapp.html).

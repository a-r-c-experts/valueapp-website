# Tutorial – step by step through the ValueApp

This tutorial walks you through the ValueApp using a concrete example project.  
The focus is on **what to enter in each tab**, **why it matters**, and **how to read the results**.

If you want conceptual background while reading, keep  
[Definitions](definitions.html) or [How the app works](how-it-works.html) open in another tab.

## Overview — Four tabs, one method

The ValueApp is structured into four tabs:

- **Beschrieb** – project identity and context  
- **Projekt** – quantity, use mix and complexity  
- **Leistung** – role, services and hours  
- **Zusammenfassung** – consolidated one-pager  

They follow the logic of the ETH Value Method from project context to effort and service distribution.

*The app connects project description, determinants, adjustment factors and services into one coherent flow.*

## Step 1 — Beschrieb (describe the project)

Start with a clear project description. These inputs appear in reports and provide context when projects are reviewed, compared or discussed later.

Capture:

- project title and address,  
- project status (e.g. *In Planung*, *Ausführung*),  
- organisational setup on the planning and contractor side,  
- a short text describing scope, task and key constraints (5–10 lines).

Good descriptions make later complexity assessments **defensible and transparent**.

    Use the “Speichern” button to store your progress.
    The “Feedback” button opens a short form where you can report issues or suggest improvements.
  </p>
</div>

## Step 2 — Projekt (quantity, uses and complexity)

In the **Projekt** tab you translate the brief into numbers and a structured complexity assessment.

### 2.1 Determinant and use mix

Enter the **determinant**, usually the gross floor area (GF).  
Then assign percentages of this quantity to the relevant uses.

This tells the app which **base models** to apply and how to combine them.

*All gross floor area assigned to “Ausbilden und forschen”.*

For detailed explanations of determinants and use mix, see the  
[Project section](project-section.html).

### 2.2 Complexity and challenges

Describe project challenges in four dimensions:

- design  
- technical  
- spatial  
- organisational  

Position them in the **Leadership Framework**.

  <source src="/wiki-assets/app-complexity-challenges-popup.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

*Project-specific challenges positioned in the framework.*

The app calculates an **adjustment factor (AF_quality)** based on the centre of gravity of your entries.  
This shifts the expected effort **within** the prediction interval of the base model.

If this feels abstract, read  
[Definitions](definitions.html) or [How the app works](how-it-works.html).

---

### 2.3 Risk level (if applicable)

Set the risk level:

- **none**,  
- **increased**,  
- **high requirements**.

This reflects uncertainty and may influence the **upper part of the effort range**.

---

## Step 3 — Leistung (role and hours by phase)

In the **Leistung** tab you define your responsibility and review how the calculated effort is distributed.

You typically:

- choose your role (Architect / Architect & General planner / General planner),  
- mark focus topics (design, construction management, cost planning),  
- review total hours for **100% basic services**,  
- check and, if justified, adjust the distribution across SIA phases.

*Roles, focus topics and calculated hours per phase.*

### Multiple disciplines

For multi-discipline projects (architecture, structural, electrical, HVAC, sanitary):

- repeat **Projekt** and **Leistung** for each discipline,  
- the **Zusammenfassung** tab will display them side by side.

---

## Step 4 — Zusammenfassung (reading the one-pager)

The **Zusammenfassung** tab is read-only. It consolidates:

- project description and organisational setup,  
- use mix and determinant,  
- effort per m²,  
- risk level,  
- hours per SIA phase,  
- additional services where relevant.

This one-pager can be exported or printed and attached to:

- fee offers,  
- internal planning or controlling documents,  
- procurement or tender documentation.

Its purpose is to document **why** a certain effort range is plausible given the project’s determinants and complexity.

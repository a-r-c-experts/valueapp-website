# Tutorial – Step by step through the ValueApp

This tutorial guides you through the ValueApp using a concrete example project.  
The focus is on **what you enter**, **why it matters**, and **how to read and use the result**.

The tutorial mirrors the real structure of the app and follows the same sequence you see on screen.

If you need conceptual background while reading, keep  
[Definitions](definitions.html) or [How the app works](how-it-works.html) open in a second tab.

---

## At a glance

**What you need**
- a rough project idea (size, use, task),
- an approximate quantity (e.g. gross floor area),
- a basic understanding of your role in the project.

**What you get**
- a traceable effort range,
- hours by phase and discipline,
- a one-page PDF for proposals, planning, or procurement.

**Time required**
- first estimate: ~10–15 minutes  
- refined version: depends on how honest you are about complexity

---

## The four main steps

1. **Describe the project (Description)**  
   Define project identity, task, location, and organisational setup.

2. **Define quantity, uses, and complexity (Project)**  
   Enter the determining quantity, define the use mix, assess complexity and risk.  
   The app derives an adjustment factor via the Leadership Framework.

3. **Define role and services (Services)**  
   Select a role, set focus topics, and review the calculated hours for  
   **100% basic services**, including distribution across planning phases.

4. **Review and export the summary (Summary)**  
   Review the one-pager and export it as documentation or a proposal.

## 0 — Orientation: how the ValueApp works

### What the ValueApp does

The ValueApp estimates and documents **planning effort** by combining:

- quantitative inputs (quantity, use mix),
- qualitative inputs (complexity, risk),
- organisational context,
- your role and service scope.

It delivers **ranges and distributions**, not a single “correct” number.

### What the ValueApp does *not* do

- It does not calculate fees automatically.
- It does not replace professional judgement.
- It does not guarantee outcomes.

![ValueApp purpose overview](/wiki-assets/tutorial/intro-valueapp-purpose.jpeg)

**Further reading**
- [How the app works](how-it-works.html) (method and logic)
- [Definitions](definitions.html) (terms in the UI)
- [What ValueApp is – and what it is not](why-valueapp.html)

---

### Standards and regions

The examples use **Swiss standards** (e.g. SIA phases) because the underlying data comes from this context.  
The **method itself is generic** and applicable internationally.

If you work outside Switzerland:
- interpret phases as generic planning phases,
- focus on **relative distributions**, not labels,
- adopt the structure and the reasoning.

---

## Step 1 — Describe the project

The **Description** step documents the project context.  
This information appears in the summary and should be shareable with stakeholders.

> **Important:**  
> Cost-related inputs do **not** influence the effort.  
> Organisation, task type, and scope **do**.

---

### 1.1 Project details

**Goal**  
Create a clear, shared project identity.

**Do**
- Enter project name and address.
- Select project status.
- Select task (e.g. new build or refurbishment).
- Write a short project description (5–10 lines).

**Check**
- The description clearly explains *what kind of project this is*.
- A third person understands the context when reading it.

![Description – project details filled](/wiki-assets/tutorial/description-project-details.jpeg)

  <video class="wiki-img" controls preload="metadata">
    <source src="/wiki-assets/tutorial/description-project-details.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</details>

**Why this matters**
- The description is what others read in the exported summary.
- Good descriptions reduce follow-up questions and misunderstandings.

**Common mistakes**
- Marketing text instead of scope and boundary conditions.
- The description is not updated even though the project evolves.

---

### 1.2 Location

**Goal**  
Document where the project is planned.

**Do**
- Move the map.
- Mark the project location.

**Check**
- The marker is set correctly.

  </video>
</details>

> **Does not influence effort**  
> Location statistics are used only as context.

---

### 1.3 Organisational setup

**Goal**  
Define how responsibilities are structured.

**Do**
- Select an organisational model on the **planner side**.
- Select an organisational model on the **contractor side**.

**Check**
- The selection matches contractual reality, not wishful thinking.

![Description – organisation setup](/wiki-assets/tutorial/description-organisation-setup.jpeg)

  <video class="wiki-img" controls preload="metadata">
    <source src="/wiki-assets/tutorial/description-organisation-setup.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</details>

**Why this matters**
- Organisation influences **phase responsibility**.
- It influences the **interpretation** of phase percentages later.

**Good practice**
- Evaluate organisation early.
- Do not change the model mid-project unless unavoidable.

**Further reading**
- [Reference](reference.html) (interpreting phase distributions)

---

### 1.4 Task type: new build vs. refurbishment

**Goal**  
Define the type of intervention.

**Do**
- Select *New build* or *Refurbishment*.
- If available: define intervention depth.

**Check**
- The task matches the real scope, not the budget narrative.

![Description – task selection](/wiki-assets/tutorial/description-task-selection.jpeg)

  <video class="wiki-img" controls preload="metadata">
    <source src="/wiki-assets/tutorial/description-task-selection.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</details>

> **Influences effort**  
> Task type and intervention depth influence effort.  
> Cost factors do not.

**Common mistakes**
- Selecting *Refurbishment* “because a building exists”, even though the scope is effectively new build.
- Setting intervention depth too low in early phases.

---

## Step 2 — Define quantity, uses, and complexity

This step provides the **first effort estimate**.

If you want the conceptual overview of fields and logic, see:  
→ [Project section](project-section.html)

---

### 2.1 Define roles

**Goal**  
Define **for which professional roles** the effort is calculated.

The ValueApp always calculates effort **by role**.  
Without roles, there is no meaningful statement about total effort.

**Do**
- Activate the relevant roles:
  - Architecture
  - Structural engineering
  - Electrical
  - Heating / ventilation
  - Sanitary
- Select roles that are actually commissioned or should be assessed.

**Check**
- Only active roles are included in the calculation.
- Each role will be shown separately later.

![Project – roles selection](/wiki-assets/tutorial/project-roles-selection.jpeg)

  <video class="wiki-img" controls preload="metadata">
    <source src="/wiki-assets/tutorial/project-roles-selection.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</details>

**Why this matters**
- Different roles have different base models.
- Complexity and risk do **not** affect all disciplines identically.
- Transparent role selection prevents misunderstandings later in proposals and discussions.

**Common mistakes**
- Activating all roles “just in case”.
- Selecting roles even though they are not commissioned on the project side.
- Changing roles later without re-checking results.

- [Definitions](definitions.html) (role vs. service)

---

### 2.2 Determining quantity

**Goal**  
Define project size.

**Do**
- Enter an approximate gross floor area (or relevant unit).
- Enter the total value, not per floor.

**Check**
- Quantity covers the entire project.

![Project – enter quantity](/wiki-assets/tutorial/project-enter-quantity.jpeg)

<p><strong>🎬 Video (optional):</strong> <strong>Click to play</strong></p>
<details class="wiki-video">
  <summary><strong> Watch a short clip</strong></summary>
  <video class="wiki-img" controls preload="metadata">
    <source src="/wiki-assets/tutorial/project-enter-quantity.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</details>

**Why this matters**
- The base model uses quantity as the main driver of the initial range.

**Common mistakes**
- Entering net area instead of gross area.
- Forgetting basements or shared/common areas.

**Further reading**
- [Project section](project-section.html) (quantities and use categories)
- [Quantity](quantity.html) (what counts, what doesn’t, and why)

---

### 2.3 Use mix

**Goal**  
Tell the app *what the project is used for*.

**Do**
- Add at least one use.
- Set percentages so the total equals 100%.
- Reorder uses if needed.

**Check**
- The complexity area becomes available.
- A min/m² value appears.

![Use mix example](/wiki-assets/tutorial/project-use-mix.jpeg)

<p><strong>🎬 Video (optional):</strong> <strong>Click to play</strong></p>
<details class="wiki-video">

  <video class="wiki-img" controls preload="metadata">
    <source src="/wiki-assets/tutorial/project-use-mix.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</details>

**Why this matters**
- The use mix selects the relevant base models and changes the expected effort.

**Further reading**
- [Use categories](use-categories.html) (what each use represents, with examples)

---

### 2.4 Complexity assessment

**Goal**  
Explain why this project is simpler or more demanding than a reference case.

**What complexity is**
- A representation of **requirements and approach**, not just aesthetics.
- A way to document professional judgement.

**Do**
- Assess complexity in four dimensions:
  - Design
  - Spatial
  - Technical
  - Organisational
- Place challenges within the Leadership Framework.

![Project – complexity framework](/wiki-assets/tutorial/project-complexity-framework.jpeg)

  <video class="wiki-img" controls preload="metadata">
    <source src="/wiki-assets/tutorial/project-complexity-framework.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</details>

**Check**
- The adjustment factor changes.
- The reasoning is explainable to the client.

**Short examples**
- Simple housing project → more *simple/complicated*
- Inner-city hospital refurbishment → *complex/unclear* in multiple dimensions

**Common mistake**
- Increasing complexity just to “get more hours”.

- [How the app works](how-it-works.html) (how complexity influences the range)
- [Complexity dimensions](complexity.html)
- [Adjustment factor (Leadership factor)](adjustment-factor.html)

---

### 2.5 Risk assessment

**Goal**  
Represent planning uncertainty.

**Do**
- Select a risk level.
- Document a justification (if possible).

**Check**
- Risk acts externally (objections, interruptions), not internally (design quality).

![Project – risk assessment](/wiki-assets/tutorial/project-risk-assessment.jpeg)

<p><strong>🎬 Video (optional):</strong> <strong>Click to play</strong></p>
<details class="wiki-video">
  <summary><strong> Watch a short clip</strong></summary>
  <video class="wiki-img" controls preload="metadata">
    <source src="/wiki-assets/tutorial/project-risk-assessment.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</details>

**Why this matters**
- Risk documents uncertainty in early phases, when many things are still unknown.

**Further reading**
- [Definitions](definitions.html) (risk)
- [How the app works](how-it-works.html) (risk vs. complexity)

---

## Step 3 — Define services

This step adapts the effort to **your responsibility**.

---

### 3.1 Select role

**Goal**  
Represent contractual scope of services.

**Do**
- Select a role (e.g. Architect, Architect & General Planner).

**Check**
- The role matches the contract, not the ambition.

![Services – select role](/wiki-assets/tutorial/services-select-role.jpeg)

<p><strong>🎬 Video (optional):</strong> <strong>Click to play</strong></p>
<details class="wiki-video">
  <summary><strong> Watch a short clip</strong></summary>
  <video class="wiki-img" controls preload="metadata">
    <source src="/wiki-assets/tutorial/services-select-role.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</details>

**Common mistakes**
- Choosing a broader role than contractually agreed.
- Forgetting: output is **basic services** by default.

**Further reading**
- [Roles and services](roles-and-services.html) (what roles include and exclude)

---

### 3.2 Focus topics

**Goal**  
Make special responsibilities visible.

**Do**
- Select relevant focus topics.

**Check**
- Focus topics explain emphasis, not “inflate scope”.

![Services – focus topics](/wiki-assets/tutorial/services-focus-topics.jpeg)

  <video class="wiki-img" controls preload="metadata">
    <source src="/wiki-assets/tutorial/services-focus-topics.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</details>

**Further reading**
- [Best practices](best-practices.html) (documenting assumptions cleanly)

---

### 3.3 Hours and phase distribution

**Goal**  
Understand phase distribution and adjust if needed.

**Do**
- Review suggested phase percentages.
- Adjust if your service delivery deviates from the standard.

**Check**
- Total hours remain constant.
- Shifts are plausible.

![Services – hours and phases](/wiki-assets/tutorial/services-hours-phases.jpeg)

<p><strong>🎬 Video (optional):</strong> <strong>Click to play</strong></p>
<details class="wiki-video">
  <summary><strong> Watch a short clip</strong></summary>
  <video class="wiki-img" controls preload="metadata">
    <source src="/wiki-assets/tutorial/services-hours-phases.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</details>

**Reading example**
- Total effort: 240 h  
- Phase 3 at 33% → ~79 h  
- Phase 5 at 48% → ~115 h

**Why this matters**
- Phase distribution influences planning and procurement, even if total hours stay the same.

- [Reference](reference.html) (phases and interpretation)
- [Output interpretation](output-interpretation.html) (reading hours, ranges, and phases)

---

### 3.4 Project-specific and additional services

**Goal**  
Document deviations from basic services.

**Do**
- Adjust subphases if needed.
- Add additional services with a description.

**Check**
- Additional services are explicit and traceable.

![Services – additional services](/wiki-assets/tutorial/services-additional-services.jpeg)

<p><strong>🎬 Video (optional):</strong> <strong>Click to play</strong></p>
<details class="wiki-video">
  <summary><strong> Watch a short clip</strong></summary>
  <video class="wiki-img" controls preload="metadata">
    <source src="/wiki-assets/tutorial/services-additional-services.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</details>

**Common mistakes**
- Additional services without a description.
- Using additional services as a correction for poor earlier inputs (quantity/use/complexity).

**Further reading**
- [Definitions](definitions.html) (basic services vs. additional services)

---

## Step 4 — Review and export the summary

---

### 4.1 Review the one-pager

**Goal**  
Ensure that result and inputs match.

**Do**
- Read through all sections.
- Check for inconsistencies.

**Check**
- Every number is explainable.

![Summary – review one-pager](/wiki-assets/tutorial/summary-review.jpeg)

<p><strong>🎬 Video (optional):</strong> <strong>Click to play</strong></p>
<details class="wiki-video">
  <summary><strong> Watch a short clip</strong></summary>
  <video class="wiki-img" controls preload="metadata">
    <source src="/wiki-assets/tutorial/summary-review.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</details>

**Why this matters**
- The summary is what you share. If it’s unclear, the conversation becomes unclear.

**Before sharing**
- [What ValueApp is – and what it is not](why-valueapp.html)

---

### 4.2 Export and use the PDF

**Goal**  
Create a document for practice.

**Do**
- Export the PDF.
- Attach it to proposals or procurement documents.

**Check**
- The PDF explains assumptions, not just numbers.

![Summary – export PDF](/wiki-assets/tutorial/summary-export-pdf.jpeg)

<p><strong>🎬 Video (optional):</strong> <strong>Click to play</strong></p>
<details class="wiki-video">
  <summary><strong> Watch a short clip</strong></summary>
  <video class="wiki-img" controls preload="metadata">
    <source src="/wiki-assets/tutorial/summary-export-pdf.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</details>

**Template sentence for proposals**
> “The proposed effort range is based on project quantity, use mix, complexity, risk, organisational setup, and service scope, documented in the attached ValueApp summary.”

---

## 5 — Mini example (Quick sanity check)

Use this to verify a plausible result before sharing it.

**Example**
- Project type: housing building
- Quantity: ~16000 m² GFA
- Use mix: 92% housing 8% office
- Complexity: moderate (technical + organisational)
- Risk: no specific requirements
- Role: architect

**What typically moves the result most**
- changing the use mix (typology),
- complexity assessment (especially organisational),
- role and phase distribution.

[Examples](examples.html) (more reference projects) and  
[Best practices](best-practices.html) (documenting assumptions clearly for clients)

---

## Typical problems and how to solve them

- **Complexity is locked** → No use selected.
- **Numbers look wrong** → Check quantity and unit.
- **Phases show 0 hours** → Check role and selected phases.
- **Client questions the result** → Review the description and the complexity reasoning.
- **Result feels “too high/too low”** → Check use mix, complexity, and role before adding additional services.

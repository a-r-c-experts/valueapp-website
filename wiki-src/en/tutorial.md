# Tutorial – Step by step through the ValueApp

This tutorial walks you through the ValueApp using a concrete example project.  
The focus is on **what to enter**, **why it matters**, and **how to read and use the result**.

The tutorial mirrors the real structure of the app and follows the same sequence you see on screen.

If you want conceptual background while reading, keep  
[Definitions](definitions.html) or [How the app works](how-it-works.html) open in another tab.

---

## At a glance

**What you need**
- a rough project idea (scale, use, task),
- an approximate quantity (e.g. gross floor area),
- a basic understanding of your role in the project.

**What you get**
- a traceable effort range,
- hours by phase and discipline,
- a one-page PDF for offers, planning, or procurement.

**Time to complete**
- first estimate: ~10–15 minutes  
- refined version: depends on how honest you are with complexity

---

## The four main steps

1. **Describe the project (Description)**  
   Define project identity, task, location, and organisational setup.

2. **Define quantity, uses, and complexity (Project)**  
   Enter the determining quantity, define the use mix, assess complexity and risk.  
   The app derives an adjustment factor via the Leadership Framework.

3. **Define your role and services (Services)**  
   Select your role, focus topics, and review the calculated hours for  
   **100% basic services**, including their distribution across planning phases.

4. **Review and export the summary (Summary)**  
   Check the generated one-pager and export it for documentation or offers.

## 0 — Orientation: how the ValueApp works

### What the ValueApp does

The ValueApp estimates and documents **planning effort** by combining:

- quantitative inputs (quantity, use mix),
- qualitative inputs (complexity, risk),
- organisational context,
- your role and scope.

It produces **ranges and distributions**, not a single “correct” number.

### What the ValueApp does *not* do

- It does not calculate fees automatically.
- It does not replace professional judgement.
- It does not guarantee outcomes.

- [What ValueApp is – and what it is not](why-valueapp.html)

---

### Standards and regions

Examples use **Swiss standards** (e.g. SIA phases) because the underlying data comes from that context.  
The **method itself is generic** and applicable internationally.

If you work outside Switzerland:
- treat phases as generic planning phases,
- focus on **relative distributions**, not labels,
- use the structure and reasoning.

---

## Step 1 — Describe the project (Description)

The **Description** step documents the project context.  
This information appears in the summary and should be shareable with stakeholders.

> **Important:**  
> Cost-related inputs do **not** affect effort.  
> Organisation, task type, and scope **do**.

---

### 1.1 Project details

**Goal**  
Create a clear, shared project identity.

**Do**
- Enter project name and address.
- Select the project status.
- Choose the task (e.g. new build or refurbishment).
- Write a short project description (5–10 lines).

**Check**
- The description clearly explains *what kind of project this is*.
- A third party could read it and understand the context.

  <video class="wiki-img" controls preload="metadata">
    <source src="/wiki-assets/tutorial/description-project-details.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</details>

**Why this matters**
- The description is what others will read in the exported summary.
- Good descriptions reduce back-and-forth and prevent misinterpretation.

**Common mistakes**
- Writing marketing text instead of scope and constraints.
- Leaving the description unchanged as the project evolves.

---

### 1.2 Location

**Goal**  
Document where the project is planned.

**Do**
- Move the map.
- Mark the project location.

**Check**
- The location marker is set correctly.

  </video>
</details>

> **Does not affect effort**  
> Location-related statistics are contextual only.

---

### 1.3 Organisational setup

**Goal**  
Define how responsibilities are structured.

**Do**
- Select the organisational model on the **planning side**.
- Select the organisational model on the **contractor side**.

**Check**
- The selected model reflects contractual reality, not wishful thinking.

![Description – organisation setup](/wiki-assets/tutorial/description-organisation-setup.jpeg)

    <source src="/wiki-assets/tutorial/description-organisation-setup.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</details>

**Why this matters**
- Organisation affects **phase responsibility**.
- It influences the **interpretation range** of phase percentages later.

**Good practice**
- Evaluate organisation early.
- Avoid changing the model mid-project unless unavoidable.

- [Reference](reference.html) (how to interpret phase distributions)

---

### 1.4 Task type: new build vs refurbishment

**Goal**  
Specify the nature of the intervention.

**Do**
- Select *New build* or *Refurbishment*.
- If applicable, define intervention depth.

**Check**
- The task reflects the real scope, not the budget narrative.

![Description – task selection](/wiki-assets/tutorial/description-task-selection.jpeg)

  </video>
</details>

> **Affects effort**  
> Task type and intervention depth influence effort.  
> Cost factors do not.

**Common mistakes**
- Picking *Refurbishment* “because there’s an existing building”, even if the scope is effectively a new build.
- Understating intervention depth in early phases.

---

## Step 2 — Define quantity, uses, and complexity (Project)

This step produces the **first effort forecast**.

If you want the conceptual overview of the fields and logic in this step, see  
→ [Project section](project-section.html)

---

### 2.1 Determining quantity

**Goal**  
Define the scale of the project.

**Do**
- Enter the approximate gross floor area (or relevant unit).
- Use total values, not per-floor values.

**Check**
- The quantity represents the whole project.

![Project – enter quantity](/wiki-assets/tutorial/project-enter-quantity.jpeg)

  <video class="wiki-img" controls preload="metadata">
    <source src="/wiki-assets/tutorial/project-enter-quantity.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</details>

**Why this matters**
- The base model uses quantity as the main driver for the initial range.

**Common mistakes**
- Entering net area instead of gross.
- Forgetting basements or shared areas.

- [Quantity](quantity.html) (what counts, what doesn’t, and why)

---

### 2.2 Use mix

**Goal**  
Tell the app *what the project is used for*.

**Do**
- Add at least one use.
- Assign percentages so the total equals 100%.
- Reorder uses if needed.

**Check**
- The complexity section unlocks.
- A min/m² value appears.

![Use mix example](/wiki-assets/tutorial/project-use-mix.jpeg)

  <video class="wiki-img" controls preload="metadata">
    <source src="/wiki-assets/tutorial/project-use-mix.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</details>

**Why this matters**
- The use mix selects the relevant base model(s) and changes the expected effort.

**Related reading**
- [Use categories](use-categories.html) (what counts as which use, with examples)

---

### 2.3 Complexity assessment

**Goal**  
Justify why this project is easier or harder than a reference case.

**What complexity is**
- A reflection of **requirements and approach**, not aesthetics alone.
- A way to document professional judgement.

**Do**
- Assess complexity in four dimensions:
  - Design
  - Spatial
  - Technical
  - Organisational
- Place challenges in the Leadership Framework.

![Project – complexity framework](/wiki-assets/tutorial/project-complexity-framework.jpeg)

  <video class="wiki-img" controls preload="metadata">
    <source src="/wiki-assets/tutorial/project-complexity-framework.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</details>

**Check**
- The adjustment factor changes.
- The reason feels explainable to a client.

**Worked example**
- Simple housing project → mostly *simple/complicated*
- Inner-city hospital retrofit → *complex/unclear* in several dimensions

**Common mistake**
- Increasing complexity just to “get more hours”.

- [How the app works](how-it-works.html) (how complexity influences the range)
- [Complexity dimensions](complexity.html) (what each dimension actually means)
- [Adjustment factor (Leadership factor)](adjustment-factor.html) (how complexity affects total effort)

---

### 2.4 Risk assessment

**Goal**  
Account for planning uncertainty.

**Do**
- Select a risk level.
- Document the reason (if possible).

**Check**
- Risk feels external (appeals, interruptions), not internal (design quality).

  <video class="wiki-img" controls preload="metadata">
    <source src="/wiki-assets/tutorial/project-risk-assessment.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</details>

**Why this matters**
- Risk helps document uncertainty in early phases, when not everything is known.

- [How the app works](how-it-works.html) (risk vs complexity)

---

## Step 3 — Define your role and services (Services)

This step adapts effort to **your responsibility**.

---

### 3.1 Select your role

**Goal**  
Define contractual scope.

**Do**
- Select your role (e.g. Architect, Architect & General Planner).

**Check**
- The role matches your contract, not your ambition.

![Services – select role](/wiki-assets/tutorial/services-select-role.jpeg)

  <video class="wiki-img" controls preload="metadata">
    <source src="/wiki-assets/tutorial/services-select-role.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</details>

**Common mistakes**
- Choosing a broader role than you are contractually responsible for.
- Forgetting that the output is for **basic services** by default.

**Related reading**
- [Roles and services](roles-and-services.html) (what roles include and exclude)

---

### 3.2 Focus topics

**Goal**  
Highlight special responsibilities.

**Do**
- Select focus topics where relevant.

**Check**
- Focus topics explain service emphasis, not inflate scope.

  </video>
</details>

**Related reading**
- [Best practices](best-practices.html) (how to document assumptions)

---

### 3.3 Hours and phase distribution

**Goal**  
Understand and, if needed, adjust phase effort.

**Do**
- Review suggested phase percentages.
- Adjust if your delivery differs from the norm.

**Check**
- Total hours remain constant.
- Phase shifts make sense.

![Services – hours and phases](/wiki-assets/tutorial/services-hours-phases.jpeg)

<p><strong>🎬 Video (optional):</strong> <strong>Click to watch</strong></p>
<details class="wiki-video">
  <summary><strong> Watch the short clip</strong></summary>
  <video class="wiki-img" controls preload="metadata">
    <source src="/wiki-assets/tutorial/services-hours-phases.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</details>

**Reading example**
- Total effort: 240 h  
- Phase 3 at 33% → ~79 h  
- Phase 5 at 48% → ~115 h

**Why this matters**
- Phase distribution affects planning and procurement conversations even when total hours stay the same.

- [Output interpretation](output-interpretation.html) (how to read hours, ranges, and phases)

---

### 3.4 Project-specific and additional services

**Goal**  
Document deviations from basic services.

**Do**
- Adjust sub-phases if needed.
- Add additional services with descriptions.

**Check**
- Additional services are explicit and traceable.

![Services – additional services](/wiki-assets/tutorial/services-additional-services.jpeg)

<p><strong>🎬 Video (optional):</strong> <strong>Click to watch</strong></p>
<details class="wiki-video">
  <summary><strong> Watch the short clip</strong></summary>
  <video class="wiki-img" controls preload="metadata">
    <source src="/wiki-assets/tutorial/services-additional-services.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</details>

**Common mistakes**
- Adding “additional services” without a description.
- Using additional services to correct bad inputs earlier (quantity/use/complexity).

**Related reading**
- [Definitions](definitions.html) (basic vs additional services)

---

## Step 4 — Review and export the summary (Summary)

---

### 4.1 Review the one-pager

**Goal**  
Verify that the result matches your inputs.

**Do**
- Read through all sections.
- Check for inconsistencies.

**Check**
- You can explain every number.

![Summary – review one-pager](/wiki-assets/tutorial/summary-review.jpeg)

<p><strong>🎬 Video (optional):</strong> <strong>Click to watch</strong></p>
<details class="wiki-video">
  <summary><strong> Watch the short clip</strong></summary>
  <video class="wiki-img" controls preload="metadata">
    <source src="/wiki-assets/tutorial/summary-review.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</details>

**Why this matters**
- The summary is what you can share. If it’s unclear, the conversation will be unclear.

**Before sharing**
- [What ValueApp is – and what it is not](why-valueapp.html)

---

### 4.2 Export and use the PDF

**Goal**  
Create a document for real-world use.

**Do**
- Export the PDF.
- Attach it to offers or procurement documents.

**Check**
- The PDF explains assumptions, not just numbers.

![Summary – export PDF](/wiki-assets/tutorial/summary-export-pdf.jpeg)

<p><strong>🎬 Video (optional):</strong> <strong>Click to watch</strong></p>
<details class="wiki-video">
  <summary><strong> Watch the short clip</strong></summary>
  <video class="wiki-img" controls preload="metadata">
    <source src="/wiki-assets/tutorial/summary-export-pdf.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</details>

**Template sentence for offers**
> “The proposed effort range is based on project quantity, use mix, complexity, risk, organisational setup, and service scope, documented in the attached ValueApp summary.”

---

## 5 — Worked mini-example (quick sanity check)

Use this to validate you’re getting a plausible result before sharing it.

**Example**
- Project type: Kindergarten (small education building)
- Quantity: ~850 m² GF
- Use mix: 100% Education
- Complexity: moderate (technical + organisational)
- Risk: medium
- Role: Architect

**What usually moves the result most**
- use mix changes (typology),
- complexity assessment (especially organisational),
- role and phase distribution.

[Best practices](best-practices.html) (how to document assumptions for clients).

---

## Typical problems and how to fix them

- **Complexity is locked** → No use selected.
- **Numbers feel wrong** → Check quantity and unit.
- **Phases show 0 hours** → Check role and selected phases.
- **Client questions the result** → Review Description and complexity justification.
- **Result feels “too high/too low”** → Re-check use mix, complexity, and role before adding additional services.

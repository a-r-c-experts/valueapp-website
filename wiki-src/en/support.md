## Optional but very useful for a future chat assistant

Structured question-and-answer pages significantly improve semantic search and embeddings, for example:

- “How do I create a project?”
- “What does AF quality mean?”
- Example-based Q&A  
  (“How should this result be interpreted in this case?”)

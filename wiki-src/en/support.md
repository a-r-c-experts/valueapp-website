# Support

This chapter is for fast answers, reducing back-and-forth, and helping users get unstuck with minimal drama.

## FAQ (existing)

- **FAQ**: frequent questions from practice.  
  → [Open FAQ](faq.html)

## Planned support pages

- **Glossary / abbreviations** (existing or expanded)
- **Help and contact**
- **Best practices and recommendations**

## Optional but very useful for a future chat assistant

Structured question-and-answer pages improve semantic search and embeddings, for example:

- “How do I create a project?”
- “What does AF quality mean?”
- Example-driven Q&A (“In this case, what should I interpret?”)

# How the app works

This page explains, at a conceptual level, what the ValueApp does between your inputs and the final one‑pager. If you want the “click here, type this” version, jump to the [Tutorial](tutorial.html).

## The idea in one sentence

The ValueApp estimates planning effort (hours) for basic services by combining a **base model** (from reference projects) with a **determinant** (usually gross floor area) and **adjustment factors** (complexity and context).

## What happens from left to right

### 1) You describe the project

In **Description (Beschrieb)** you capture the identity of the project and the organisational setup. This matters because results are meant to be communicated and archived, not just stared at.

### 2) You define quantity, uses and complexity

In **Project (Projekt)** you enter:

- the **determinant** (e.g. m² gross floor area),
- the **mix of uses** (housing, work, learning, etc.),
- and a structured **complexity assessment** (design, technical, spatial, organisational).

That complexity is mapped to the Leadership Framework and translated into an **adjustment factor**.

### 3) You select role and service setup

In **Services (Leistung)** you choose your role (architect, general planner, etc.), mark focus topics and review the calculated hours for 100% basic services, including the default distribution across phases.

### 4) You validate and export

In **Summary (Zusammenfassung)** the app consolidates the inputs and results into a one‑pager for communication (offer, internal controlling, procurement, documentation).

## What is calculated

At a simplified level, the method can be written as:

**Effort (h) = Base effort × Determinant × AF_quality × AF_project/process**

- **Base effort** comes from a statistical base model for a given use.
- **Determinant** scales effort (typically m²).
- **AF_quality** reflects the complexity of design/technical/spatial/organisational challenges.
- **AF_project/process** captures additional context or process effects, where applicable.

If those terms feel abstract, the [Definitions](definitions.html) page breaks them down.

## What the result is (and is not)

- The output is a **plausible effort range** anchored in comparable reference projects.
- It is **not** a fee calculator and it does **not** replace professional judgement.
- The value is transparency: assumptions are visible, discussable and documentable.

# Introduction

Welcome to the ValueApp User Wiki. This section helps you get oriented fast: what the ValueApp is, where to start, and what to read next depending on your goal.

## Start here

- **Home**: the main wiki overview page.  
  → [Open the Wiki Home](index.html)

- **Getting started**: the quickest path from “what is this” to “I can use it”.  
  → [Open Getting started](getting-started.html)

## Conceptual orientation

If you want to understand *what happens between your inputs and the final result*, start with these pages:

- **How the app works**  
  A conceptual explanation of data flow, phases, calculation logic, and outputs.  
  → [How the app works](how-it-works.html)

- **Why ValueApp exists**  
  The problem it addresses, typical use cases, and what it deliberately does *not* do  
  (not a fee calculator, not a cost tool).  
  → [Why ValueApp exists](why-valueapp.html)

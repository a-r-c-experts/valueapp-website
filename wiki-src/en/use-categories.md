# Use categories (building programs)

Use categories define **what kind of project you are planning**.  
They determine which **reference models** are used as the baseline for effort estimation.

The ValueApp does not treat “use” as a label.  
It treats use as a **proxy for typical requirements, coordination effort, and planning intensity**.

This page explains how use categories work and provides practical examples for mapping real projects to the model structure.

---

## What a use category does

A use category:

- selects one or more **base models**,
- defines a typical **effort per unit** range,
- influences how complexity and adjustment factors act on the result.

If a project combines multiple uses, the ValueApp creates a **weighted combination** of the corresponding models.

---

## How to use this list

Use the categories as **orientation**, not as a rigid taxonomy.

Good practice:
- choose the category that best reflects **planning effort**, not marketing language,
- prefer the **dominant functional requirement** over minor secondary uses,
- split mixed-use projects into several uses and assign percentages.

## Typical mapping problems

- **“It’s mixed-use, so we pick one category”**  
  → Split uses and assign percentages.

- **“It’s housing, but very special”**  
  → Keep the use, reflect the difference in **complexity**, not by changing the category.

- **“It’s small, so it’s simple”**  
  → Size and use are different drivers. Complexity is assessed separately.

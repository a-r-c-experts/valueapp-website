# Quantity and baseline effort

Quantity defines the **scale of the project**.  
It is the primary driver of baseline effort in ValueApp.

Everything else (complexity, adjustment factor) **modifies** this baseline.  
Nothing replaces it.

---

## What quantity means in ValueApp

In ValueApp, quantity represents:
- the **size of what is being planned**,
- expressed through a **single, dominant quantity**.

It answers the question:

> *“How much project is there?”*

Not:
- how difficult it is,
- how well organised it is,
- how ambitious the design is.

Those are handled elsewhere.

---

## Typical quantities used

Depending on project type, quantity is usually expressed as:

- **Gross floor area (GFA / BGF)**  
  Most common for buildings.

- **Units**  
  For housing, rooms, or repetitive elements.

- **Functional area**  
  When only part of a building is relevant.

The key rule is:
> **Use the quantity that best represents planning effort**, not construction cost.

---

## Why quantity matters so much

Quantity is the **only factor that scales effort predictably**.

Doubling the quantity does not double effort linearly, but:
- it increases coordination,
- increases documentation,
- increases repetition with variation.

ValueApp’s baseline curves are calibrated so that:
- small projects are not overestimated,
- large projects are not naïvely extrapolated.

---

## How quantity affects results

Quantity:
- defines the **baseline effort range**,
- applies across all planning phases,
- interacts with complexity rather than replacing it.

A larger quantity means:
- more drawings,
- more coordination cycles,
- more interfaces to manage.

But quantity alone does **not** explain:
- why two projects of the same size differ significantly,
- why some small projects are disproportionately demanding.

That is why complexity and adjustment factors exist.

---

## Choosing the right quantity

When in doubt:

- Prefer **slightly too simple** over overly precise.
- Use **one dominant quantity**, not several.
- Avoid “optimised” quantities chosen to influence results.

If the number feels debatable, document the assumption rather than refining it endlessly.

Precision without clarity is not accuracy.

---

## Where quantity appears in the app

You define quantity in:

- **Project setup**  
  As the first substantive input.

- **Baseline calculation**  
  Where it anchors all further adjustments.

- **Result summary**  
  Where it explains scale-related effort differences.

## Common mistakes to avoid

Do not:
- mix net and gross areas inconsistently,
- exclude “uncomfortable” parts of the project,
- change quantity late to correct an outcome.

If changing quantity significantly alters the result, that is not a bug.  
It means the project scope changed.

---

## Optional visual reference

The relationship between quantity and baseline effort is **non-linear**:

![Quantity vs baseline effort curve](\/wiki-assets/knowledge/quantity-baseline-curve.jpg)

The curve reflects:
- economies of repetition,
- increasing coordination load at scale.
